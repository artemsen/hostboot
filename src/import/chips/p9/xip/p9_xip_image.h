/// \param[in,out] io_image A pointer to a P9-XIP image in host memory.  The
/// image is assumed to be consistent with the information contained in the
/// header regarding the presence of and sizes of all sections. The image is
/// also required to have been normalized.
///
/// \param[in] i_sectionId Identifies the section to contain the new data.
///
/// \param[in] i_data A pointer to the data to be appended to the image.  If
/// this pointer is NULL (0), then the effect is as if \a i_data were a
/// pointer to an \a i_size array of 0 bytes.
///
/// \param[in] i_size The size of the data to be appended in bytes.  If \a
/// i_data is 0, then this is the number of bytes to clear.
///
/// \param[in] i_allocation The size of the memory region containing the
/// image, measured from the first byte of the image.  The call will fail if
/// appending the new data plus any alignment padding would overflow the
/// allocated memory.
///
/// \param[out] o_sectionOffset If non-0 at entry, then the API updates the
/// location pointed to by \a o_sectionOffset with the offset of the first
/// byte of the appended data within the indicated section. This return value
/// is invalid in the event of a non-0 return code.
///
/// \param[in] i_ddSupport Specifies if the section contains ddLevel sub-
/// sections (=1) or if it does not have ddLevel support (=0).
///
/// This API copies data from \a i_data to the end of the indicated \a
/// i_section.  The section \a i_section must either be empty, or must be the
/// final (highest address) section in the image.  If the section is initially
/// empty and \a i_size is non-0 then the section is created at the end of the
/// image.  The size of \a i_section and the size of the image are always
/// adjusted to reflect the newly added data.  This is a simple binary copy
/// without any interpretation (e.g., endian-translation) of the copied data.
/// The caller is responsible for insuring that the host memory area
/// containing the P9-XIP image is large enough to hold the newly appended
/// data without causing addressing errors or buffer overrun errors.
///
/// The final parameter \a o_sectionOffset is optional, and may be passed as
/// NULL (0) if the application does not require the information.  This return
/// value is provided to simplify typical use cases of this API:
///
/// - A scan program is appended to the image, or a run-time data area is
/// allocated and cleared at the end of the image.
///
/// - Pointer variables in the image are updated with IMAGE addresses obtained
/// via p9_xip_section2image(), or
/// other procedure code initializes a newly allocated and cleared data area
/// via host addresses obtained from p9_xip_section2host().
///
/// Regarding alignment, note that the P9-XIP format requires that sections
/// maintain an initial alignment that varies by section, and the API will
/// enforce these alignment constraints for all sections created by the API.
/// All alignment is relative to the first byte of the image (\a io_image) -
/// \e not to the current in-memory address of the image. By specification
/// P9-XIP images must be loaded at a 4K alignment in order for IMAGE hardware
/// relocation to work, however the APIs don't require this 4K alignment for
/// in-memory manipulation of images.  Images to be executed on ImageVe will
/// normally require at least 8-byte final aligment in order to guarantee that
/// the ImageVe can execute an 8-byte fetch or load/store of the final
/// doubleword.
///
/// \note If the TOC section is modified then the image is marked as having an
/// unsorted TOC.

/// \note If the call fails for any reason (other than a bug in the API
/// itself) then the \a io_image data is returned unmodified.
